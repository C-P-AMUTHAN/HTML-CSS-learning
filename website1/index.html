    <p style="text-align: justify;">The flood waters swirling and running through residential areas of Ennore and Eranavur have a thick film of oil covering it. The oil is forming a layer on the walls, the objects it touches inside flooded homes and people crossing the water to get out of their homes.  
        A video made by two volunteers of Vijay Makkal Iyakkam crossing the oil-layered waters while carrying relief to residents went viral on social media on Thursday. Vicky, one of the volunteers, told The Hindu that he and his friend Kishore had to wade through the flood water since the residents had contacted them for assistance and had asked for water. “We had to scrub several times to remove the oil from our body. The clothes had to be discarded, as they could not be salvaged. I can still smell the oil,” he said.
